## Welcome to my page
### A few things for me
I hold an MEng in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, but I simply like to consider myself just an avid learner.
I am interested in AI and Data Science, although I admit I am slightly _biased_ towards Reinforcement Learning!

Without further ado, I will dive into the projects that have already been completed.

#### Projects related to the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree
This was the first chance for me to become acquainted with the Pytorch framework and practical implementation of some of the most
intriguing and promissing Neural Networks applications.

1. *Convolutional Neural Network*:
this project was all about the implementation of a neural network that can identify dog-breeds in images and classify
them into 133 distinct categories. The power of transfer learning is also demonstrated through this project when a pre-trained VGG-16 comes to the rescue!

2. *Recurrent Neural Network*:
This project included the construction of an RNN which is able to create TV scripts. It is trained in a corpus of scripts derived from 10 seasons of a TV sitcom. It is pretty fun!...and with further training or training on different documents, it can even write its own poems!

3. *Generative Adversarial Network*:
In this project, a GAN was developed whose aim is to generate faces out of pure white noise. It gets trained by trying to fool a separate classifying network into believing that the faces it generates are real. And it does a pretty good job....well, at least it would fool a human!
