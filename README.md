## Welcome to my page
### A few things for me
I have a MEng in Electrical Engineering and computer science, but I like to consider myself just an avid learner.
I am interested in AI and Data Science, although I admit I am slightly _biased_ towards Reinforcement Learning!

Without further ado, I will dive into the projects that have already been completed.

#### Projects related to the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree
This was the first chance for me to become acquainted with the Pytorch framework and practical implementation of some of the most
intriguing and promissing Neural Networks applications.

1. Convolutial Neural Network: this project was all about the implementation of a neural network that can identify dog-breeds and classify
them. The power of transfer learning is also demonstrated through this project when a pre-trained VGG-16 comes to the rescue!
